	 C is a procedural programming language.</br>
	 It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972.</br>
	 It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system.</br>
	 The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.<br/>
      Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. <br/>
	  Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. <br/>
	  C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).</br>
